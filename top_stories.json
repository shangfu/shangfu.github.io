It was challenging and full ofmeaningful decisions that promised major impact both later in the game and in its coming sequels. It used the familiar to create something memorable while never pretending to reach for the widest possible audience. In short, it was a game that felt like it should have never been published by a monolithic mainstream publisher like Electronic Arts, which had purchased developer BioWare in late 2007.In 2011, Dragon Age 2 was just the opposite—a tightly budgeted, sparse, and populist attempt at aping the RPG flavor of the week.
