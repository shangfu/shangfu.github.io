### Notes

- State Smart Transportation Initiative ([SSTI](http://www.ssti.us))

- Example: how many jobs can be accessed within X minitues by bus/transit/auto. We can draw an accessibility intensity distribution. 
Furthermore, draw the intensity distribution every minute varying the traffic from 7am-9am, and then average them to get 
the picture about accessibility in traffic.


- $$
Accessibility~Score = \sum \frac{Opportunities}{Travel~Time \times Decay}
$$
where: **Opportunities** is number of jobs (or something), **Decay** is the factor reflecting decrease in value of opportunity that
are further away, which is different for each travel model. 


- Problem about analytic tool support:
> Existing tools lack sensitivity for complex planning and programming needs. 


- NCHRP 8-78 Accessibility Model => Multimodel accessibility (MMA). These new tools can be stand-alone scenario planning tools or to **supplement state/MPO TAZ model**.
